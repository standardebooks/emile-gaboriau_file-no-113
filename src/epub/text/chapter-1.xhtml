			<h2>I</h2>
			<p>In the Paris evening papers of Tuesday, February 28, 1866, under the head of <i>Local Items</i>, the following announcement appeared:</p>
			<p>“A daring robbery, committed against one of our most eminent bankers, <abbr>M.</abbr> Andre Fauvel, caused great excitement this morning throughout the neighborhood of Rue de Provence.</p>
			<p>“The thieves, who were as skilful as they were bold, succeeded in making an entrance to the bank, in forcing the lock of a safe that has heretofore been considered impregnable, and in possessing themselves of the enormous sum of three hundred and fifty thousand francs in bank-notes.</p>
			<p>“The police, immediately informed of the robbery, displayed their accustomed zeal, and their efforts have been crowned with success. Already, it is said, P. B., a clerk in the bank, has been arrested, and there is every reason to hope that his accomplices will be speedily overtaken by the hand of justice.”</p>
			<p>For four days this robbery was the town talk of Paris.</p>
			<p>Then public attention was absorbed by later and equally interesting events: an acrobat broke his leg at the circus; an actress made her debut at a small theatre: and the <i>item</i> of the 28th was soon forgotten.</p>
			<p>But for once the newspapers were⁠—perhaps intentionally⁠—wrong, or at least inaccurate in their information.</p>
			<p>The sum of three hundred and fifty thousand francs certainly had been stolen from <abbr>M.</abbr> Andre Fauvel’s bank, but not in the manner described.</p>
			<p>A clerk had also been arrested on suspicion, but no decisive proof had been found against him. This robbery of unusual importance remained, if not inexplicable, at least unexplained.</p>
			<p>The following are the facts as they were related with scrupulous exactness at the preliminary examination.</p>
